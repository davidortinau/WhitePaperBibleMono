[Segment](https://segment.io) is a better analytics API. Instrument your app once and install hundreds of analytics tools with the flip of a switch, instead of weeks of extra development work.

If you're using tools like Google Analytics or Omniture, your code starts to look like this:

```csharp
GAI.SharedInstance.DefaultTracker.Set (GAIConstants.ScreenName, "Login");
GAI.SharedInstance.DefaultTracker.Send (GAIDictionaryBuilder.CreateAppView ().Build ());
AppMeasurement omniture = new AppMeasurement();
omniture.account = "myCorp";
omniture.dc = "d1";
omniture.pageName = "Login";
omniture.track();
Tracker tracker = new Mixpanel.Tracker("mipxanel-api-key");
tracker.Track("Login");
```

Our cleaner API turns all of this into one call: 

```csharp
Analytics.Screen("userId", "Login");
```
